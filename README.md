 Higher or Lower Game (Python)

A console-based game where you guess which celebrity or brand has more Instagram followers.

## 📌 Overview

This project was developed as part of **Day 14** of the *100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Bootcamp* by Dr. Angela Yu. The game randomly selects two public figures and challenges the player to guess who has more followers. Correct answers increase your score; the game ends when you guess wrong.
